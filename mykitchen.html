<h2>Southern Food For The Soul</h2>
<p> Nothing makes the your heart melt more than a good meal. Thats why in my kitchen a good ole southern meal and souther hospitality is sure to bring a crowd. With recipes passed down from southern grandparents and deep rooted with love, one of my favorite dishes to cook is a seafood shrimp and grits.

What are some of your favorite southern inspired dishes to cook in your own home?
